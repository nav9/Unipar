Unipar
======

A software I created for my lecturer who wanted a software with which he could explain to students, the normal and tangential forces that are applied on a beam. The software also depicts graphs of the same. The 3D projection equations used, are ones I derived myself, using trignometry rules. The name "Unipar" is a combination of my name and the name of my lecturer.
The program was created and compiled with Turbo C
